# Voxel-wise encoding model 
With this matlab code you will be able to run encoding model analysis with the banded ridge regression method proposed by ([Nunez-Elizalde et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811919302988?via%3Dihub)). 
Instead of the ridge function (a built-in matlab function), bridge function is used to have more than 1 ridge penalty. 
 
encoding_bridge.m is used for voxel-wise encoding model analysis.
variance_partitioning.m is used for variance_partitioning analysis.
in the help folder, bridge provides beta estimates and corresponding lambda values.
